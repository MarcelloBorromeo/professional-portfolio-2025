        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Business & Data Science student at Arizona State University passionate about blending
          analytics with creativity to solve meaningful problems. My early-career experience spans product management, software
          engineering, and AI-based consulting across companies like Walmart, Insight, and YellowBird.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on building tools that connect people and drive innovation. Outside of work, I explore how data and design
          intersect to make technology more human-centered and impactful.
