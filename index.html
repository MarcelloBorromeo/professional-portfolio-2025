      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Business & Data Science student at Arizona State University passionate about blending
        analytics with creativity to solve meaningful problems. My early-career experience spans product management, software
        engineering, and AI-based consulting across companies like Walmart, Insight, and YellowBird.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on building tools that connect people and drive innovation. Outside of work, I explore how data and design
        intersect to make technology more human-centered and impactful.
