        <h1>My Story</h1>
       <p>
 When I started my undergrad, I began with a dream of
  becoming an actor. What started as a passion for storytelling and connecting with audiences evolved into a strength
  for communicating ideas, connecting teams, and translating complex problems into simple, human solutions.
</p>
<p>
  When OpenAI ignited the modern AI wave, I shifted my stage from performance to innovation — studying business and data
  science to understand how technology shapes people, decisions, and impact. Along the way, I’ve worked with companies
  like Starbucks and Walmart on cutting-edge AI initiatives, from Walmart’s defect-inspection tunnel to an AI-powered
  investor-relations matchmaking platform for a Wall Street firm.
</p>
<p>
  My work is grounded in a simple belief: ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they lead with curiosity and
  empathy. That’s the core of my personal brand — using data to tell stories that inspire action and help build a better,
  smarter future.
